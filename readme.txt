You MUST install python in order to run this program
(I have Python 3.10.4, but if a later version is released, it should work)

Program version: 1.1

To run the program:
  1. Make sure you have Python installed
  2. In command prompt, move to the directory of the main.py file (cd <directory>)
  3. Run "python main.py"
